## Overview of the Project
![image](https://github.com/MinfangYu/Ray-Tracer-OpenGL/blob/master/scene.jpg)

My ray tracer is in a forest with a sun, a tree, two magic bubbles(one is transparent and another is refraction) and one magic reflective blue bubble mirror.
Transparent and refractive spheres have lighter shadows. There are two light sources and every object has two shadows.
